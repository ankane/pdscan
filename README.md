- Email addresses
- IP addresses (IPv4)
- Street addresses (US)
- Phone numbers (US)
- Credit card numbers
- Social security numbers
- Dates of birth
- Location data
- OAuth tokens

Uses data sampling and naming, and works with compressed files

:boom: Zero runtime dependencies and minimal database load

## Data Stores

- [Files](#files)
- [MySQL & MariaDB](#mysql--mariadb)
- [Postgres](#postgres)
- [SQLite](#sqlite)
- [SQL Server](#sql-server) [unreleased]
- [S3](#s3)
- [Others](#others)

### Files

```sh
pdscan file://path/to/file.txt
```

You can also specify a directory.

```sh
pdscan file://path/to/directory
```

For absolute paths, use `file:///`.

### MySQL & MariaDB

```sh
pdscan mysql://user:pass@host:3306/dbname
```

### Postgres

```sh
pdscan postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
```

If your connection doesnâ€™t use SSL, append to the URI:

```
?sslmode=disable
```

For best sampling, enable the [tsm_system_rows](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tsm-system-rows.html) extension (ships with Postgres 9.5+).

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION tsm_system_rows;
```

### SQLite

```sh
pdscan sqlite:/path/to/dbname.sqlite3
```

### SQL Server

```sh
pdscan sqlserver://user:pass@host:1433?database=dbname
```

### S3

```sh
pdscan s3://bucket/path/to/file.txt
```

> Requires `s3:GetObject` permission

You can also specify a prefix by ending with a `/`.

```sh
pdscan s3://bucket/path/to/directory/
```

> Requires `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` permissions

### Others
