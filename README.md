### Elasticsearch

```sh
pdscan elasticsearch+http://user:pass@host:9200
```

> Requires Elasticsearch 7 at the moment

For HTTPS, use `elasticsearch+https://`.

You can also specify indices.

```sh
pdscan elasticsearch+http://user:pass@host:9200/index1,index2
```

Wildcards are also supported.

```sh
pdscan "elasticsearch+http://user:pass@host:9200/index*"
```

### Files

```sh
pdscan file://path/to/file.txt
```

You can also specify a directory.

```sh
pdscan file://path/to/directory
```

For absolute paths, use `file:///`.

### MariaDB

```sh
pdscan mariadb://user:pass@host:3306/dbname
```

### MongoDB

```sh
pdscan mongodb://user:pass@host:27017/dbname
```

### MySQL

```sh
pdscan mysql://user:pass@host:3306/dbname
```

### OpenSearch

```sh
pdscan opensearch+http://user:pass@host:9200
```

For HTTPS, use `opensearch+https://`.

You can also specify indices.

```sh
pdscan opensearch+http://user:pass@host:9200/index1,index2
```

Wildcards are also supported.

```sh
pdscan "opensearch+http://user:pass@host:9200/index*"
```

### Postgres

```sh
pdscan postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
```

If your connection doesnâ€™t use SSL, append to the URI:

```
?sslmode=disable
```

For best sampling, enable the [tsm_system_rows](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tsm-system-rows.html) extension (ships with Postgres 9.5+).

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION tsm_system_rows;
```

### Redis

```sh
pdscan redis://user:pass@host:6379/db
```

Only scans string keys at the moment

### SQLite

```sh
pdscan sqlite:/path/to/dbname.sqlite3
```

### SQL Server

```sh
pdscan "sqlserver://user:pass@host:1433?database=dbname"
```

### S3

```sh
pdscan s3://bucket/path/to/file.txt
```

> Requires `s3:GetObject` permission

You can also specify a prefix by ending with a `/`.

```sh
pdscan s3://bucket/path/to/directory/
```

> Requires `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` permissions

## Options

Show data found

```sh
pdscan --show-data
```

Show low confidence matches

```sh
pdscan --show-all
```
